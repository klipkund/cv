      <p><em>Honours Graduate of <strong>Environmental Sciences</strong></em></p>

<br>

      <p>I am a researcher at heart. I have completed my honours degree in ecological remediation. My
        knowledge and interest lies in any relevant field of environmental management and especially
        ecology. I am capable of doing critical research with an added set of skills supplied by my time working
        as a student assistant. I am confident in my skills to work in both English and Afrikaans proficiently.</p>

      <p>But, a new path has opened to me that I’d like to pursue. I consider affiliate marketing and online SEO
        management my entry to even greater possibilities that a pure degree can’t offer. Nonetheless, I am
        a firm believer of transdisciplinary applications of knowledge.</p>

      <p>I have adopted the philosophy known as Kaizen. I believe in self-improvement even when times allow
        me to rest. I aim to become a sustainable member of the community and look forward to the
        knowledge I have yet to learn.</p></td>
